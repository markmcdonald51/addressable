Address
=======

This is a simple address model that is useful for using in all applications that 
need a good geo reference. This class strives to be GIS, but is a work in progress. 
The GIS functions (acts_as_geom) will only work with PostGIS and Postgresql. 

Example
=======

I use this in many of my models as an addressable polymorphic association as such:


  has_one :address, :as => :addressable, 
    :class_name => 'Address', :dependent => :destroy
    
  or
  
  has_many :addresses, :as => :addressable,  
    :class_name => 'Address', :dependent => :destroy
